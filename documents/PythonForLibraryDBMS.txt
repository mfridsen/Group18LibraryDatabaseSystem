It is possible to integrate a Python program that generates statistical reports with the Java application.
One way to do this is to use the Java Native Interface (JNI) to call the Python code from within the Java application. Another way is to use a library like Jython, which allows you to run Python code within a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Jython can be used to write Python code that can be called from within the Java application, or to write Java code that can be called from within Python.

Generating statistical reports: Python has many powerful libraries for generating statistical reports,
such as pandas and numpy. You could use these libraries to analyze the data in your database and generate
reports on things like book circulation rates, patron demographics, and popular genres.

Data visualization: Python also has powerful data visualization libraries like matplotlib and seaborn that
could be used to create visualizations of the data in your database. For example, you could create a
pie chart or bar graph to show the distribution of book genres in the library.

Machine learning: Python has a number of machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn that could be used
to develop predictive models for the library. For example, you could use machine learning to predict
which books are likely to be checked out next based on historical data.
