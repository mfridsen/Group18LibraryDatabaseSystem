 *
 * Here's a general outline of the steps to connect a Java application to a database:
 *
 * Load the JDBC driver: To connect to a database, you first need to load the JDBC driver specific to the database
 * you're using. For example, if you're using MySQL, you would load the MySQL DatabaseConnection/J driver.
 *
 * Establish a connection: Once you've loaded the driver, you can establish a connection to the database.
 * To do this, you'll need to provide the database URL, username, and password.
 *
 * Create a statement: After establishing a connection, you can create a statement to execute SQL commands.
 *
 * You can use the Statement interface or the PreparedStatement interface to create a statement.
 *
 * Execute SQL commands: Using the statement, you can execute various SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
 * and DELETE, to interact with the database.
 *
 * Close the connection: Finally, you should always close the connection to the database when you're done.
